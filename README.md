# MySocialFeed – Flam iOS Assignment

This is a sample iOS Social Media Feed App built using MVVM architecture and Combine.  
Since I currently don’t have access to a Mac system, this GitHub repository contains the complete structured SwiftUI project with:

- Models for User and Post
- ViewModel for state handling
- Reusable SwiftUI views
- Dummy data setup
- Fully organized files and comments

## Architecture Used:
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Combine (for reactive binding)
- SwiftUI (for the UI layer)

## Note:
This code is written and structured with clear intention to show my understanding of clean iOS development, even though I couldn't simulate it without Xcode.
